    "\n",
    "### 🌐 **Docker Contexts & Remote Hosts**\n",
    "\n",
    "Manage multiple Docker environments (local, cloud, remote).\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "docker context create my-remote --docker \"host=ssh://user@remotehost\"\n",
    "docker context use my-remote\n",
    "```\n",

    "✅ Helps you switch between **local and remote Docker engines** easily.\n",

    "### ⚙️ **Docker BuildKit**\n",
    "\n",
    "A faster, more powerful image builder with features like **parallel builds** and **cache mounts**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Enable BuildKit:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "export DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "💡 Use advanced syntax in Dockerfile:\n",
    "\n",
    "```dockerfile\n",
    "# syntax=docker/dockerfile:1.4\n",
    "RUN --mount=type=cache,target=/root/.cache pip install -r requirements.txt\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### ❤️‍🩹 **Health Checks in Dockerfile**\n",
    "\n",
    "Define **container health conditions** (for retries/restarts).\n",
    "\n",
    "```dockerfile\n",
    "HEALTHCHECK --interval=30s --timeout=10s --retries=3 \\\n",
    "  CMD curl -f http://localhost/ || exit 1\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "🔁 Docker can then monitor and restart **unhealthy** containers.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🧼 **Init Containers**\n",
    "\n",
    "Used to **initialize a container** before the main app starts (commonly used in Kubernetes).\n",
    "\n",
    "In Docker, mimic this using a small `ENTRYPOINT` wrapper script that runs setup tasks before starting the main process.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📁 **Copy-on-write Filesystem**\n",
    "\n",
    "Every Docker image layer uses a **copy-on-write** mechanism.\n",
    "⏱️ This allows fast container startup and small storage overhead by **reusing layers** unless changes are made.\n",
    "\n",
    "🔍 Optimizing layers = smaller, faster, cleaner images.\n",
