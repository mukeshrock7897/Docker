    "# üåê 6. Docker Networking\n",
    "\n",
    "## A) What it is\n",
    "\n",
    "Containers get virtual NICs + IPs so they can talk to **host**, **internet**, and **each other**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## B) Network types (use when)\n",
    "\n",
    "* **bridge** (default) ‚Üí single-host, isolated apps.\n",
    "* **user-defined bridge** ‚Üí name-based DNS between containers (‚úÖ recommended).\n",
    "* **host** ‚Üí share host network **(Linux only)**; no port-mapping overhead.\n",
    "* **none** ‚Üí fully isolated (tests/security).\n",
    "* **overlay** ‚Üí multi-host (Swarm).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## C) Core commands (with meaning)\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "docker network ls                            # list networks\n",
    "docker network create mynet                  # make user-defined bridge\n",
    "docker network inspect mynet                 # see subnets, members\n",
    "docker network rm mynet                      # delete (if unused)\n",
    "docker network connect mynet <container>     # attach container to network\n",
    "docker network disconnect mynet <container>  # detach\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## D) Default vs user-defined bridge\n",
    "\n",
    "* **default `bridge`**: no DNS ‚Üí use IPs only.\n",
    "* **user-defined `bridge`**: DNS by container name works.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "docker network create appnet\n",
    "docker run -d --name web --network appnet nginx\n",
    "docker run --rm -it --network appnet busybox ping -c1 web   # resolves by name ‚úÖ\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## E) Publish ports (host ‚Üî container)\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "docker run -d -p 8080:80 nginx     # host:8080 ‚Üí container:80\n",
    "# EXPOSE in Dockerfile is doc-only; use -p to reach from host.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## F) Host networking (Linux only)\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "docker run --network host nginx     # shares host net; no -p needed\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Use for high throughput / many ports. Not available on Desktop the same way.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## G) Multi-network & discover IP\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "docker network connect appnet web2\n",
    "docker inspect -f '{{range .NetworkSettings.Networks}}{{.IPAddress}}{{end}}' web\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## H) Quick recipes\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# App + DB on same user network\n",
    "docker network create dbnet\n",
    "docker run -d --name db  --network dbnet postgres\n",
    "docker run -d --name api --network dbnet myapi     # API can use hostname \"db\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# One-off curl test\n",
    "docker run --rm --network dbnet curlimages/curl:8.10.1 -s http://api:8080/health\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## I) Best practices (1-liners)\n",
    "\n",
    "* Use **user-defined bridge** for app stacks (DNS, isolation).\n",
    "* Keep ports closed by default; **publish only what you need**.\n",
    "* Name networks per stack (e.g., `shop_net`) for clarity.\n",
    "* Prefer **Compose** to define networks declaratively later.\n"
