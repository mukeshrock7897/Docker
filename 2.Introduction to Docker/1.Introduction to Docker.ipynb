    "**Definition**:\n",
    "Docker is a platform that allows developers to **package applications and their dependencies** into lightweight, portable containers.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why Use It?**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Consistent across all environments (dev ‚Üí test ‚Üí prod)\n",
    "* Lightweight and fast (compared to virtual machines)\n",
    "* Easy deployment, scaling, and isolation\n",
    "* Great for **ML, GenAI, APIs, microservices, CI/CD**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example Use**:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "docker run hello-world\n",
    "```\n",

    "| Feature        | Virtual Machines (VMs)               | Docker Containers               |\n",
    "| -------------- | ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------- |\n",
    "| Boot Time      | Minutes                              | Seconds                         |\n",
    "| Size           | GBs (with OS)                        | MBs (app only)                  |\n",
    "| OS Requirement | Guest OS required                    | Shares host OS kernel           |\n",
    "| Performance    | Slower due to full OS virtualization | Faster due to direct kernel use |\n",

    "\n",
    "* **Image**: Read-only **blueprint/template** for creating containers (e.g., `python:3.10`)\n",
    "* **Container**: **Running instance** of an image ‚Äì includes the app + environment\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "docker pull python:3.10          # Image\n",

    "* The core component that runs containers\n",
    "* Includes the daemon and CLI\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. **Docker Daemon (`dockerd`)**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Runs in background and **manages containers, images, volumes, networks**\n",
    "* Communicates with CLI and Docker API\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. **Docker CLI**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Command-line interface to interact with Docker (e.g., `docker run`, `docker build`)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. **Docker Registry (Docker Hub)**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Public or private **image repository**\n",
    "* Docker Hub is the default, but you can also use:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * GitHub Container Registry\n",
    "  * AWS ECR / GCP Artifact Registry\n",
